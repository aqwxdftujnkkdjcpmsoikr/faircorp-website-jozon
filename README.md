# Website for the web & mobile programming course
Project done using mostly pure javascript, since it was started this way and I was encouraged to continue.
<br>Project can be hosted locally using vscode extensions.
>Depending on your setup simply using a html viewer on index.html should work too (paths to stylesheet and images are setup correctly, using firefox to view the index.html worked for me).
